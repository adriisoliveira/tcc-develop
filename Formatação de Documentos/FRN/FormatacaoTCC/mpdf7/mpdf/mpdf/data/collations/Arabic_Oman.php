If\n  dynamic assignment of new variables is desired, then add\n  "\'__dict__\'" to the sequence of strings in the *__slots__*\n  declaration.\n\n  Changed in version 2.3: Previously, adding "\'__dict__\'" to the\n  *__slots__* declaration would not enable the assignment of new\n  attributes not specifically listed in the sequence of instance\n  variable names.\n\n* Without a *__weakref__* variable for each instance, classes\n  defining *__slots__* do not support weak references to its\n  instances. If weak reference support is needed, then add\n  "\'__weakref__\'" to the sequence of strings in the *__slots__*\n  declaration.\n\n  Changed in version 2.3: Previously, adding "\'__weakref__\'" to the\n  *__slots__* declaration would not enable support for weak\n  references.\n\n* *__slots__* are implemented at the class level b
